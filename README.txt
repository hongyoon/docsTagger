The source code is written Python 3.4
- Python 3 comes with tkinter (Python default GUI)
- http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/

Required third party package program
- Pillow: Python image library (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
- vlc (version 2.0.*)
- vlc.py (http://liris.cnrs.fr/advene/download/python-ctypes/2.0/vlc.py)
- Although the latest vlc version is 2.1.5, I find 2.0.* more stable
- If you are using other vlc version, then you have to update vlc.py accordingly

Future Works:
- Contral bar in a canvas
- full Class definition for Menu bar
- Save session feature

Comment:
- I find wrapping vlc into tkinter a dirty solution, but I couldn't find a good Python video library for Python 3.4
